`CEFOracle` is a Julia module inteded to analyze and model the single-ion
properties of $4f$ electron systems in a systematic way.
The crystalline-electric field (CEF) at the position of the magnetic ion in a
solid is modelled in the Stevens formalism and a full CEF matrix is constructed.
The full CEF matrix is diagonalized and with it, physical properties of the
single-ion system can be calculated and compared with experimental results.
The effect of an external magnetic field can also be taken into account 
when calculating physical observables.

To add the module in a Julia session type:
```julia
julia> ]
pkg> add https://github.com/abehersan/CEFOracle/tree/main
```

For a complete list of the functions afforded by the module and their
structure please consult the source files themselves or invoke
the docstrings in the REPL via help mode.
Running the code below will print the documentation for the `cef_eigensystem`
function for example:
```julia
julia> ? 
help?> cef_eigensystem
```

In particular, functions available upon module import are listed in `CEFOracle.jl`.
Other functions within the module can be accessed by typing `CEFOracle.FUNCTIONNAME`.
