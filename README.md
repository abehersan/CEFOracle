# CEFOracle

`CEFOracle` is a Julia module inteded to model and analyze the single-ion
properties of $4f$ electron magnetic insulators.
The crystal electric field (CEF) Hamiltonian for a tripositive rare-earth
magnetic ion in a solid is modelled in the Stevens formalism and a full CEF
matrix is constructed.

The full CEF matrix is diagonalized and physical observables can be calculated
using the resulting characteristic energies and wavefunctions.
This calculation can be compared to experimental results.
The effect of an external magnetic field can also be taken into account in the
calculation.

The static magnetic susceptibility, the magnetization, magnetic moment,
specific heat capacity and inelastic neutron scattering cross-sections can
be calculated by `CEFOracle` given a CEF Hamiltonian for both polycrystalline
and single-crystal samples.

The single-ion Hamiltonian treated in `CEFOracle` is the following:

```math
\hat{\mathcal{H}} =
\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{CEF}} + \hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{Zeeman}} =
\sum_{l\in\{2, 4, 6\}}\sum_{m=-l}^{l} B_{l}^{m}\hat{O}_{l}^{m}(J) +
\mu_{\text{B}}\mathbf{B}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{g}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{I}}(J).
```

where $`\hat{O}^m_l(J)`$ are the extended Stevens operators (ESOs). Values of
$`l \in [2, 4, 6]`$ and $`m \in [-l, l]`$ are most relevant in spectroscopical
studies of real materials. The ESOs are given as a function of the total angular
momentum quantum number $J$, see Ryabov (1999) and Rudowicz (2015).

The Hamiltonian is given as a function of the  total-angular momentum matrices
$\hat{I}_x, \hat{I}_y, \hat{I}_z$.
And possibly an external magnetic field $`\boldsymbol{B}=(B_x, B_y, B_z)`$
with components in units of Tesla. A generalized g-tensor can also be included
in the calculations.
